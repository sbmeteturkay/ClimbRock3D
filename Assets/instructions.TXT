you can edit player launch speed, linearSawSpeed, handlePositionGap by values.json file.
you need to create new value in json for every level. example
   
   {
      "obstacleLinearStartSpeed": "5",
      "handlePositionGap": "4",
      "climbSpeed": "1"
    }


linearSawSpeed= linear moving red saw speed
handle position gap= unused for now. it was created for porductive level generator.
climb speed= player launch speed to an handle to handle


**LEVEL CREATION**
you can duplicate level02 scene by CTRL+D to create a level. level02 has all handles and obstacles in it.
you can change positioning of nahdles&obstacles in Environment<HANDLES. All wall objects are here.
you can add new objects from Prefabs file. This file has all handles and Obstacle prefabs.
you can extend the level by changing Environment<TopGround y position in scene.  You should add more handles so player can reach finish handle.
ground has start position objects. if you want to adjust them its on Environment<Ground.
if you want to edit saw speeds by per object you must select object and in ObstacleMovement, set true SetSpeedOn value and set speed.
